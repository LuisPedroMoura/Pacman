#! ##########   PAC-MAN AGENT GLOBAL STRATEGY   ##########

    #! ###    CONCEPTS    ###

    #! Corridor
        #* A list of path coordinates with only two adjacent coordinates
        #* and two crossroads as ends

    #! Crossroad
        #* A coordinate that joins corridors. The crossroad belong to all
        #* corridors it joins

    #! Corridor SAFE vs UNSAFE
        #* SAFE - Has no ghosts
        #* UNSAFE - Has one or more ghosts

    #! Crossroad GREEN - YELLOW - RED
        #* Refers to the crossroads directly accessible to Pac-Man (the
        #* ends of it's corridor)
        #* GREEN - No ghosts in proximity
        #* YELLOW - There are ghosts at a dangerous distance of the crossroad
        #*          (default = 1). Pac-Man can escape if he goes directly through
        #*          that end
        #* RED - Considering that the ghosts is in pursuit of Pac-Man, it is
        #*       impossible for Pac-Man to escape from that end before the ghost
        #*       gets to it (or the ghost is already inside Pac-Man's Corridor)


    #! Strategy Game Modes
        #* EATING_MODE - Pac-Man is safe. Focus on eating energies. Tries to
        #*               find closest energies through safest paths
        #* COUNTER_MODE - Pac-Man is almost surrounded. Focus on eating boosts.
        #* PURSUIT_MODE - Pac-Man is safe and there are zombie ghosts.
        #*               Focus on eating ghosts.
        #* FLIGHT_MODE - Pac-Man is almost surrounded. There are no boosts
        #*               available. Focus on finding the closest safest Corridor.

    #! Static Analysis of Map provides
        #* pathways
        #* corridors
        #* crossroads
        #* corridor_adjacencies
    
    #! Strategy Guidelines
        #* Pac-Man Agent calls Strategy Advisor
        #*      Strategy Advisor analyses:
        #*          Corridor Safety
        #*          Crossroads Semaphores
        #*          Distance to ghosts
        #*      Strategy Advisor advises a Game Mode
        #* Pac-Man calls Game Mode Agent to get next move
        #*      Game Mode tries to find the next move
        #* Pac-Man analyses next move
        #*      Is it specific (only one solution)
        #*          Pac-Man accepts next move
        #*      It's not specific (strategy was not correct)
        #*          Pac-Man calls Strategy Adjuster
        #*              Strategy Adjuster evaluates new info and advises a new Game Mode
        #*          Pac-Man call Game Mode Agent to get next move
        #*              Game Mode tries to find a solution
        #*          Pac-Man accepts best solution found (if more than one)
