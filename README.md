# The_Cheddar_Project
Artificial Intelligence to survive as score the most points as Pac-Man.

Version 1:
Started as a 3-person group project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
with the challenge of creating an algorithm that enabled PAC-MAN to complete a 
traditional maze having a time constraint for calculations.
I took the responsibility of developing all the logic and strategy, which resulted 
in one of the most complex yet efficient algorithms of the class, layered with
map topography and situation analysis, strategy advisory and validation. It scored 
consistently about 20\% above the second place.
Then a small bug in the maze analysis in the last evaluation froze Pac-Man and severely 
undercut our grade.

Version 2:
I applied for a special examination, in order to improve my grade, delivering a second 
individual project, created from scratch in 3 days. The algorithm is not efficient, 
but the new strategy yielded very good overall results (improved final class grade!) 
is a very promising approach if efficiency is improved or time constraints are relaxed.
This version includes a command line viewer made for fun and to provide faster debugging.
